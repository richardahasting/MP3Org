  - Template-based approach with JAudioTagger integration
  - Detailed phase breakdown with builder pattern API design
  - Usage examples for duplicate detection, edge cases, and performance testing
  - **Status**: Ready for implementation when approved

### **Active Work Items**
**Current Task**: Issue #16 - TestDataFactory Implementation (IN PROGRESS - Session 2025-07-05)
- ‚úÖ Implementation substantially complete - full package structure created
- ‚úÖ Audio template files provided: shortRecording10sec.mp3 and shortRecording20sec.mp3
- ‚úÖ Core classes implemented: TestDataFactory, TestFileGenerator, TestTemplateManager
- ‚úÖ Builder pattern specs: TestFileSpec, DuplicateSpec, EdgeCaseSpec, TestDataSetSpec
- üîÑ **Current Phase**: Review, test, document, and integrate with proper git workflow

**Next Steps**: 
- Create feature branch for Issue #16 (following git workflow requirements)
- Review implementation completeness against issue16-plan.md requirements
- Test functionality with provided audio templates
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation
- Commit and create pull request

### **Next Priority Tasks**
1. **Issue #1 - JavaDoc Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: MP3OrgApplication.java, MusicFile.java, DatabaseManager.java
   - **Remaining**: UI classes (ConfigurationView, DuplicateManagerView, MetadataEditorView, ImportOrganizeView)
   - **Priority**: High - UI classes need documentation

2. **Issue #2 - Code Formatting** (Not Started)
   - **Scope**: Apply consistent formatting across entire codebase
   - **Priority**: Medium - Can be automated with IDE tools

3. **Issue #3 - Architecture Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: Refactoring summaries exist
   - **Remaining**: Comprehensive architecture overview
   - **Priority**: Low - Nice to have

### **Current Blockers**
*None - all test infrastructure issues resolved*

### **Outstanding Git Workflow Issue**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Workflow Violation**: Sessions consistently working directly on main branch instead of creating feature branches
- **Previous violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #12 test cleanup)
- **Current violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #13 integration testing)
- **Resolution**: Added Git workflow requirements to CLAUDE.md, but need consistent enforcement
- **Action**: Future work MUST use branch-per-issue approach - NO exceptions

### **Key Context for Next Session**
- **Test Suite**: 100% passing, reliable build
- **Infrastructure**: Robust test base with real audio files in src/test/resources/audio/
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md updated with Git workflow requirements
- **Repository**: Clean state, all changes committed

### **Session Continuity Notes**
- User emphasized importance of persistent guidance in CLAUDE.md
- Established automatic behaviors working well
- Need to maintain branch-per-issue workflow going forward
- Developer log maintenance is functioning correctly
