  - Successfully implemented comprehensive TestDataFactory system with 13 new classes
  - Template-based generation using actual audio files for realistic test scenarios
  - Integrated with existing test suite (BulkEditingTest, DatabaseManagerTest, FuzzyMatcherTest)
  - All 26 tests passing with enhanced coverage and automatic cleanup
  - **Status**: PR #32 created and ready for review, feature branch merged

### **Active Work Items**
**Current Task**: TEST Profile Prefix Enforcement (COMPLETING - Session 2025-07-05)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete**: Updated test infrastructure to enforce TEST-prefixed profiles
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 Complete**: All 26 tests passing with TEST-HARNESS profile
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 Complete**: Created Issue #33 and feature branch
- üîÑ **Current Phase**: Committing changes and creating pull request

**Completed Changes**:
- ‚úÖ Updated TestHarness.java to use "TEST-HARNESS" instead of "TESTING-HARNESS"
- ‚úÖ Updated all test infrastructure files (BaseTest.java, MP3OrgTestBase.java) to use TEST prefix
- ‚úÖ Validated TestDataFactory tests work with proper profile isolation  
- ‚úÖ All 26 tests passing with TEST-prefixed profiles (100% success rate)

**Next Steps**: 
- Commit TEST profile enforcement changes to feature branch
- Create pull request for Issue #33
- Update documentation

### **Next Priority Tasks**
1. **Issue #1 - JavaDoc Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: MP3OrgApplication.java, MusicFile.java, DatabaseManager.java
   - **Remaining**: UI classes (ConfigurationView, DuplicateManagerView, MetadataEditorView, ImportOrganizeView)
   - **Priority**: High - UI classes need documentation

2. **Issue #2 - Code Formatting** (Not Started)
   - **Scope**: Apply consistent formatting across entire codebase
   - **Priority**: Medium - Can be automated with IDE tools

3. **Issue #3 - Architecture Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: Refactoring summaries exist
   - **Remaining**: Comprehensive architecture overview
   - **Priority**: Low - Nice to have

### **Current Blockers**
*None - all test infrastructure issues resolved*

### **Outstanding Git Workflow Issue**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Workflow Violation**: Sessions consistently working directly on main branch instead of creating feature branches
- **Previous violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #12 test cleanup)
- **Current violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #13 integration testing)
- **Resolution**: Added Git workflow requirements to CLAUDE.md, but need consistent enforcement
- **Action**: Future work MUST use branch-per-issue approach - NO exceptions

### **Key Context for Next Session**
- **Test Suite**: 100% passing, reliable build
- **Infrastructure**: Robust test base with real audio files in src/test/resources/audio/
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md updated with Git workflow requirements
- **Repository**: Clean state, all changes committed

### **Session Continuity Notes**
- User emphasized importance of persistent guidance in CLAUDE.md
- Established automatic behaviors working well
- Need to maintain branch-per-issue workflow going forward
- Developer log maintenance is functioning correctly
