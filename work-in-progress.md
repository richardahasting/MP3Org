# MP3Org Work In Progress

*This file tracks active work, current context, and session-to-session continuity*

## Current Status: Session 2025-07-01

### **Recently Completed (Previous Sessions)**
- ✅ **Major Performance Optimization - Parallel Duplicate Detection**: COMPLETED
  - Eliminated 3+ minute duplicate detection wait with 8,500 file database
  - Implemented parallel streams with callback-based result streaming
  - Added real-time progress updates and cancellation support
  - User tested and confirmed excellent performance improvement
  - **Status**: Code complete, compilation verified, user tested successfully

- ✅ **Systematic Workflow Improvements**: COMPLETED  
  - Updated CLAUDE.md to require work-in-progress.md updates as first todo task
  - Updated CLAUDE.md to require feature branch creation as second todo task
  - Updated CLAUDE.md to require developer log documentation as final task
  - Applied changes to CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md for future project propagation
  - **Status**: Process improvements established and documented

### **Active Work Items**
**Current Task**: Duplicate Manager Display Toggle Enhancement

**Objective**: Add toggle functionality allowing users to switch between:
1. **All Files Mode** (default) - Shows complete database in left pane on startup  
2. **Duplicates Only Mode** - Shows only potential duplicates using parallel detection

**Progress**: Planning phase - todo list created, work-in-progress.md updated

### **Next Priority Tasks**
1. **Issue #1 - JavaDoc Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: MP3OrgApplication.java, MusicFile.java, DatabaseManager.java
   - **Remaining**: UI classes (ConfigurationView, DuplicateManagerView, MetadataEditorView, ImportOrganizeView)
   - **Priority**: High - UI classes need documentation

2. **Issue #2 - Code Formatting** (Not Started)
   - **Scope**: Apply consistent formatting across entire codebase
   - **Priority**: Medium - Can be automated with IDE tools

3. **Issue #3 - Architecture Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: Refactoring summaries exist
   - **Remaining**: Comprehensive architecture overview
   - **Priority**: Low - Nice to have

### **Current Blockers**
*None - all test infrastructure issues resolved*

### **Outstanding Git Workflow Issue**
- ⚠️ **Workflow Violation**: Sessions consistently working directly on main branch instead of creating feature branches
- **Previous violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #12 test cleanup)
- **Current violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #13 integration testing)
- **Resolution**: Added Git workflow requirements to CLAUDE.md, but need consistent enforcement
- **Action**: Future work MUST use branch-per-issue approach - NO exceptions

### **Key Context for Next Session**
- **Test Suite**: 100% passing, reliable build
- **Infrastructure**: Robust test base with real audio files in src/test/resources/audio/
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md updated with Git workflow requirements
- **Repository**: Clean state, all changes committed

### **Session Continuity Notes**
- User emphasized importance of persistent guidance in CLAUDE.md
- Established automatic behaviors working well
- Need to maintain branch-per-issue workflow going forward
- Developer log maintenance is functioning correctly
