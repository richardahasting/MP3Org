- Initialize cache during database initialization
- Keep cache synchronized on insert/update/delete operations
- Add performance timing to measure improvements

### **Git Workflow Reminder**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST create feature branch for Issue #41
- Follow branch naming: `feature/issue-41-database-performance`
- Create PR when implementation complete

### **Session Continuity Notes**
- User is confident about memory usage - 10,000 rows load in under a second
- Focus on performance profiling to validate the optimization
- User wants concrete performance measurements
