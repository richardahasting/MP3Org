# MP3Org Work In Progress

*This file tracks active work, current context, and session-to-session continuity*

## Current Status: Session 2025-07-04

### **Recently Completed (Previous Sessions)**
- ✅ **Issue #25 - Circular Dependency Fix**: COMPLETED (2025-07-04)
  - Resolved StackOverflowError in logging initialization
  - Implemented early logging with default config, database config reload after init
  - Simplified DatabaseProfileManager logging patterns
  - Application now starts cleanly without circular dependencies
  - **Status**: Tested, committed (9bf5d42), pushed, GitHub issue closed

- ✅ **printStackTrace() Replacement**: COMPLETED (Previous session)
  - Replaced all 27 printStackTrace() calls with proper logging framework usage
  - Added missing logger imports to 6 files
  - Enhanced error handling with appropriate log levels
  - **Status**: Code complete, compilation verified

- ✅ **Tab Refresh Implementation**: COMPLETED (Previous session)
  - Fixed database count display showing "0" in Configuration tab
  - Added automatic tab selection listeners for content refresh
  - Fixed Duplicate Manager requiring manual refresh
  - **Status**: User tested and verified working

### **Recently Completed (Current Session)**
- ✅ **Issue #28 - Database Enhancement**: COMPLETED (2025-07-04)
  - Implemented upsert functionality with saveOrUpdateMusicFile() method
  - Added selective directory rescanning to Import tab with DirectoryItem management
  - Enhanced ImportOrganizeView with TableView-based directory selection
  - Database now gracefully handles duplicate filepath constraints with updates
  - **Status**: Committed to feature branch, tested and verified working

- ✅ **Issue #29 - Logging Configuration UI**: COMPLETED (2025-07-04)
  - Created comprehensive LoggingConfigPanel with runtime configuration
  - Integrated panel into ConfigurationView as new "Logging Configuration" tab
  - Provides global settings, component-specific levels, and runtime controls
  - Supports file logging path selection, test logging, and reset to defaults
  - **Status**: Committed to feature branch, compilation verified

### **Active Work Items**
**Current Task**: Documentation and cleanup

**Next Steps**: 
- Create pull requests for both feature branches
- Update developer-log.md with detailed implementation notes
- Test both features end-to-end

### **Next Priority Tasks**
1. **Issue #1 - JavaDoc Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: MP3OrgApplication.java, MusicFile.java, DatabaseManager.java
   - **Remaining**: UI classes (ConfigurationView, DuplicateManagerView, MetadataEditorView, ImportOrganizeView)
   - **Priority**: High - UI classes need documentation

2. **Issue #2 - Code Formatting** (Not Started)
   - **Scope**: Apply consistent formatting across entire codebase
   - **Priority**: Medium - Can be automated with IDE tools

3. **Issue #3 - Architecture Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: Refactoring summaries exist
   - **Remaining**: Comprehensive architecture overview
   - **Priority**: Low - Nice to have

### **Current Blockers**
*None - all test infrastructure issues resolved*

### **Outstanding Git Workflow Issue**
- ⚠️ **Workflow Violation**: Sessions consistently working directly on main branch instead of creating feature branches
- **Previous violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #12 test cleanup)
- **Current violation**: Session 2024-06-30 (Issue #13 integration testing)
- **Resolution**: Added Git workflow requirements to CLAUDE.md, but need consistent enforcement
- **Action**: Future work MUST use branch-per-issue approach - NO exceptions

### **Key Context for Next Session**
- **Test Suite**: 100% passing, reliable build
- **Infrastructure**: Robust test base with real audio files in src/test/resources/audio/
- **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md updated with Git workflow requirements
- **Repository**: Clean state, all changes committed

### **Session Continuity Notes**
- User emphasized importance of persistent guidance in CLAUDE.md
- Established automatic behaviors working well
- Need to maintain branch-per-issue workflow going forward
- Developer log maintenance is functioning correctly
