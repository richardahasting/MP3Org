# MP3Org Work In Progress

*This file tracks active work, current context, and session-to-session continuity*

## Current Status: Session 2025-07-07

### **Active Work Item**
**Issue #49 - Directory Rescanning Shows Wrong Directories** (IN PROGRESS)
- üîÑ **Current Phase**: Fix directory rescanning table to show original scan directories only
- **Problem**: Directory rescanning table shows every individual file's parent directory instead of the original root directories that were scanned
- **Root Cause**: `getDistinctDirectories()` extracts parent from every file path, creating overwhelming list of subdirectories
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Track original scan root directories (not every subdirectory)
  - Implement database schema to store scan directory history
  - Modify rescanning table to show only meaningful root directories
  - Preserve user intent about which directories were originally selected
- **Status**: Created Issue #49, analyzing solution approach

### **Recently Completed (Session 2025-07-05)**
- ‚úÖ **Issue #39 - Import Tab Navigation Fix**: COMPLETED
  - Fixed "Go to Import Tab" button that was doing nothing
  - Implemented TabSwitchCallback interface pattern
  - Added 16 comprehensive unit tests
  - PR #40 created with detailed code review comments
  
- ‚úÖ **Issue #37 - Configuration Tab Order Optimization**: COMPLETED
  - Reordered tabs for better user workflow
  - PR #38 merged successfully

- ‚úÖ **Issue #35 - Auto-activate newly created database profiles**: COMPLETED
  - PR #36 merged successfully

### **Recently Completed (Previous Sessions)**
- ‚úÖ **Issue #30 - Log Backup and Compression System**: PR #31 merged
- ‚úÖ **Issue #29 - Logging Configuration UI**: Comprehensive UI completed
- ‚úÖ **Issue #28 - Database Enhancement**: Upsert functionality implemented
- ‚úÖ **Issue #25 - Circular Dependency Fix**: Resolved StackOverflowError
- ‚úÖ **Issue #16 Implementation Planning**: Created 8-hour plan

### **Next Priority Tasks**
1. **Complete Issue #41** - Database Performance
   - Create feature branch
   - Convert to ConcurrentHashMap
   - Implement optimized SQL query
   - Add performance profiling
   - Create comprehensive tests

2. **Issue #1 - JavaDoc Documentation** (Partially Complete)
   - **Completed**: MP3OrgApplication.java, MusicFile.java, DatabaseManager.java
   - **Remaining**: UI classes need documentation
   - **Priority**: High

3. **Issue #2 - Code Formatting** (Not Started)
   - **Scope**: Apply consistent formatting
   - **Priority**: Medium

### **Key Implementation Notes for Issue #41**
- Use ConcurrentHashMap instead of HashMap with synchronized blocks
- Create optimized SQL: `SELECT id, file_path FROM music_files`
- Initialize cache during database initialization
- Keep cache synchronized on insert/update/delete operations
- Add performance timing to measure improvements

### **Git Workflow Reminder**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST create feature branch for Issue #41
- Follow branch naming: `feature/issue-41-database-performance`
- Create PR when implementation complete

### **Session Continuity Notes**
- User is confident about memory usage - 10,000 rows load in under a second
- Focus on performance profiling to validate the optimization
- User wants concrete performance measurements
