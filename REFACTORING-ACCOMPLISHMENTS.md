- Loose coupling between UI components
- Event-driven architecture for responsive UI

#### **Utility Pattern**
- Stateless service classes for reusability
- Pure functions for predictable behavior
- Easy unit testing and validation

#### **Facade Pattern**
- Simplified interfaces for complex subsystems
- Clean orchestration layers
- Maintained backward compatibility

### üß™ **Testing and Validation**

#### **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- **MusicFileRefactorTest**: Validation of refactored functionality
- **MetadataEditorRefactorTest**: Structural validation
- **Edge Case Testing**: Null file paths and boundary conditions
- **Backward Compatibility**: All deprecated methods validated

#### **Quality Assurance**
- **Compilation Success**: All code compiles without errors
- **Functional Testing**: No behavioral changes detected
- **Performance Testing**: No performance degradation
- **Integration Testing**: All components work together seamlessly
