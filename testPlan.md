## üéØ **Test Objectives**
- [ ] Verify Issue #26 (config tab StackOverflowError) is completely resolved
- [ ] Ensure all profile management functionality works correctly
- [ ] Validate no regressions were introduced by the fix
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Test Environment Setup**

### **Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Latest code from main branch (commit 827ed41)
- [ ] Clean build: `./gradlew clean build`
- [ ] Multiple database profiles available for testing
- [ ] Some music files in at least one database for realistic testing

### **Application Startup:**
- [ ] Run: `./gradlew run`
- [ ] **Expected:** Application starts without errors, no StackOverflowError during initialization

---

## üìã **Core Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Basic Config Tab Access** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
**Objective:** Verify the primary issue is fixed

- [ ] Launch application
- [ ] Click on "Config" tab
- [ ] Observe config tab loads properly
- [ ] Switch between other tabs (Duplicate Manager, Metadata Editor, Import & Organize)
- [ ] Return to Config tab multiple times

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Config tab opens without StackOverflowError
- [ ] ‚úÖ No infinite loop or application freeze
- [ ] ‚úÖ Tab switching is smooth and responsive
- [ ] ‚úÖ No error messages in console/logs

---

### **Test 2: Profile Switching Functionality** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
**Objective:** Verify profile switching works correctly after the fix

- [ ] Go to Config tab ‚Üí Database Profiles section
- [ ] Note current active profile in dropdown
- [ ] Select a different profile from dropdown
- [ ] Confirm the switch in the dialog that appears
- [ ] Verify profile information updates (name, path, music file count)
- [ ] Switch back to original profile
- [ ] Test switching between 3+ different profiles rapidly

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Profile switching completes successfully
- [ ] ‚úÖ Profile information updates correctly
- [ ] ‚úÖ Music file counts display properly
- [ ] ‚úÖ No recursive calling or infinite loops
- [ ] ‚úÖ Status messages show "Switched to profile: [name]"

---

### **Test 3: Profile Management Operations**
**Objective:** Ensure all profile operations work correctly

#### **3a. Create New Profile**
- [ ] Click "New Profile" button
- [ ] Enter profile name: "Test Profile [timestamp]"
- [ ] Select database directory
- [ ] Verify new profile appears in dropdown
- [ ] Verify new profile becomes active

#### **3b. Duplicate Profile**
- [ ] Select an existing profile
- [ ] Click "Duplicate Profile" button
- [ ] Accept default name or modify
- [ ] Verify duplicated profile appears
- [ ] Switch to duplicated profile

#### **3c. Rename Profile**
- [ ] Select a test profile
- [ ] Click "Rename Profile" button
- [ ] Enter new name: "Renamed Test Profile"
- [ ] Verify name updates in dropdown and info panel

#### **3d. Delete Profile**
- [ ] Ensure you have multiple profiles
- [ ] Select a test profile (not your main data)
- [ ] Click "Delete Profile" button
- [ ] Confirm deletion in dialog
- [ ] Verify profile removed from dropdown
- [ ] Verify application automatically switches to another profile

**Expected Results for All 3a-3d:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ All operations complete without errors
- [ ] ‚úÖ UI updates reflect changes immediately
- [ ] ‚úÖ No StackOverflowError during any operation
- [ ] ‚úÖ Profile dropdown stays consistent

---

### **Test 4: Rapid Tab Switching** ‚≠ê **STRESS TEST**
**Objective:** Test for any remaining circular dependency issues

- [ ] Rapidly switch between tabs: Config ‚Üí Duplicate Manager ‚Üí Config ‚Üí Metadata Editor ‚Üí Config
- [ ] Repeat this pattern 10 times quickly
- [ ] While in Config tab, rapidly switch between internal config tabs (if any)
- [ ] Switch profiles while rapidly switching main tabs

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ No application freezing or slowdown
- [ ] ‚úÖ No StackOverflowError
- [ ] ‚úÖ All tabs load correctly each time
- [ ] ‚úÖ Performance remains responsive

---

### **Test 5: Profile Switching Edge Cases**
**Objective:** Test edge conditions that might trigger the old bug

#### **5a. Same Profile Selection**
- [ ] Note current active profile
- [ ] Select the same profile from dropdown again
- [ ] Verify no unnecessary processing occurs

#### **5b. Profile Switch During Tab Change**
- [ ] Start switching to Config tab
- [ ] Immediately switch profiles before tab fully loads
- [ ] Switch back to another tab while profile switch is in progress

#### **5c. Multiple Profile Switches**
- [ ] Switch to Profile A
- [ ] Immediately switch to Profile B (before first switch completes)
- [ ] Immediately switch to Profile C
- [ ] Verify final state is consistent

**Expected Results for All 5a-5c:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ No errors or exceptions
- [ ] ‚úÖ Application reaches consistent state
- [ ] ‚úÖ Final active profile matches last selection
- [ ] ‚úÖ No recursive calls or infinite loops

---

### **Test 6: Error Condition Testing**
**Objective:** Ensure error handling remains robust

#### **6a. Invalid Profile Operations**
- [ ] Try to delete the last remaining profile
- [ ] Try to create profile with empty name
- [ ] Try to create profile with duplicate name
- [ ] Try to rename profile to existing name

#### **6b. Database Connection Issues**
- [ ] Switch to a profile with corrupted/missing database
- [ ] Try to access Config tab during database errors
- [ ] Verify error messages are appropriate

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Appropriate error dialogs shown
- [ ] ‚úÖ Application remains stable
- [ ] ‚úÖ No StackOverflowError even during error conditions
- [ ] ‚úÖ User can recover from error states

---

### **Test 7: Music File Count Display**
**Objective:** Verify the count display that was part of the error chain

- [ ] Switch to a profile with music files
- [ ] Verify music file count displays correctly in profile info
- [ ] Switch to empty profile, verify "0 files" or appropriate message
- [ ] Switch back to profile with files
- [ ] Verify count updates correctly

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Music file counts are accurate
- [ ] ‚úÖ Counts update properly when switching profiles
- [ ] ‚úÖ No errors during count retrieval
- [ ] ‚úÖ Formatted display is user-friendly (e.g., "1,234 files")

---

### **Test 8: Application Lifecycle**
**Objective:** Test startup and shutdown behavior

- [ ] Close and restart application multiple times
- [ ] Verify last active profile is remembered
- [ ] Test startup with different profiles as default
- [ ] Ensure clean shutdown with no hanging processes

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Consistent startup behavior
- [ ] ‚úÖ Profile state preserved between sessions
- [ ] ‚úÖ No memory leaks or hanging processes
- [ ] ‚úÖ Clean application termination
