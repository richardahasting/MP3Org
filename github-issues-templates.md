## Issue 1: Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to core classes

**Title:** Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to core classes

**Labels:** documentation, enhancement

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Enhance code maintainability by adding comprehensive JavaDoc documentation to methods and classes that are currently undocumented.

## Scope
This issue tracks the systematic addition of JavaDoc documentation across the MP3Org codebase, focusing on:

### High Priority Classes (Public API)
- [x] MP3OrgApplication.java - Main application class ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] MusicFile.java - Core model class ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] DatabaseManager.java - Database operations ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] ConfigurationView.java - UI configuration component
- [ ] DuplicateManagerView.java - Duplicate detection UI
- [ ] MetadataEditorView.java - Metadata editing UI
- [ ] ImportOrganizeView.java - File import and organization

### Medium Priority Classes (Complex Logic)
- [ ] FuzzyMatcher.java - Duplicate detection algorithms
- [ ] MusicFileScanner.java - File system scanning
- [ ] ArtistStatisticsManager.java - Artist organization logic

### Low Priority Classes (Utility Methods)
- [ ] PathTemplate.java - Path generation templates
- [ ] DatabaseConfig.java - Configuration management
- [ ] FuzzySearchConfig.java - Search configuration

## Documentation Standards
- Class-level JavaDoc explaining purpose and key features
- Method documentation with parameter descriptions
- Return value explanations
- Exception documentation where applicable
- Usage examples for complex methods
- Cross-references to related classes (@see tags)

## Progress Completed (Session 2024-12-29)
- ✅ **MP3OrgApplication.java** - Complete with class overview and all method documentation
- ✅ **MusicFile.java** - Core methods, getters/setters, and Fields enum documented
- ✅ **DatabaseManager.java** - CRUD operations, connection management, and search methods documented

## Benefits
- Improved code maintainability
- Easier developer onboarding
- Better IDE support and intellisense
- Professional code documentation standards

## Related Work
This follows the major refactoring work completed in the previous session which extracted utility classes and improved code organization.

## Issue 2: Apply consistent code formatting across entire codebase

**Title:** Apply consistent code formatting across entire codebase

**Labels:** formatting, code-quality, enhancement

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Standardize code formatting across the entire MP3Org codebase to improve readability and maintain consistent coding standards.

## Scope
Apply consistent formatting to all Java source files including:

### Formatting Standards
- **Indentation:** Consistent use of spaces/tabs
- **Line spacing:** Proper spacing around methods, classes, and logical blocks
- **Import organization:** Group and sort import statements
- **Bracket placement:** Consistent brace style (Java conventions)
- **Line length:** Appropriate line wrapping for readability
- **Comment formatting:** Consistent comment styles and placement

### Files to Format
- All `.java` files in `src/main/java/`
- All `.java` files in `src/test/java/`
- Configuration files where applicable

### Areas of Focus
1. **Core Model Classes**
   - MusicFile.java and related model classes
   
2. **Database Layer**
   - DatabaseManager.java
   - DatabaseConfig.java
   
3. **UI Components**
   - All view classes (MetadataEditorView, ConfigurationView, etc.)
   - Extracted panel classes
   
4. **Utility Classes**
   - MusicFileComparator, FileOrganizer, MetadataExtractor
   - String utilities and helper classes
   
5. **Test Classes**
   - All test files for consistency

## Implementation Plan
1. **Analysis Phase:** Review current formatting inconsistencies
2. **Standards Definition:** Establish project-wide formatting rules
3. **Automated Formatting:** Apply consistent formatting using IDE tools
4. **Manual Review:** Address any edge cases or special formatting needs
5. **Validation:** Ensure all code compiles and functions correctly after formatting

## Benefits
- Improved code readability
- Easier code reviews
- Professional appearance
- Reduced cognitive load when reading code
- Better team collaboration standards

## Dependencies
- Should be completed after documentation enhancement (Issue #1)
- No functional changes, purely formatting improvements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Java files follow consistent indentation and spacing
- [ ] Import statements are organized and sorted
- [ ] Consistent bracket and brace placement
- [ ] Proper line wrapping for long statements
- [ ] All code compiles successfully after formatting
- [ ] No functional behavior changes

## Issue 3: Document major refactoring accomplishments (Retrospective)

**Title:** Document major refactoring accomplishments from previous session

**Labels:** documentation, refactoring, retrospective

**Body:**
```markdown
## Overview
Create comprehensive documentation for the major refactoring work completed in the previous development session to maintain project history and establish patterns for future work.

## Accomplished Refactoring Work

### 1. MusicFile Class Refactoring (739 → 449 lines, -39.2%)
**Extracted Utility Classes:**
- ✅ MusicFileComparator (220 lines) - Comparison and similarity matching
- ✅ ArtistStatisticsManager (178 lines) - Artist counting and organization  
- ✅ FileOrganizer (184 lines) - File organization and copying
- ✅ MetadataExtractor (198 lines) - Audio metadata extraction

### 2. MetadataEditorView Class Refactoring (1,038 → 333 lines, -67.9%)
**Extracted Panel Components:**
- ✅ SearchPanel (374 lines) - Music file searching and results
- ✅ EditFormPanel (479 lines) - Individual metadata editing
- ✅ BulkEditPanel (358 lines) - Bulk editing operations
- ✅ FileActionPanel (426 lines) - File operations and actions
- ✅ MetadataEditorViewRefactored (333 lines) - Clean orchestration

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive architecture overview
- [ ] Document extracted component relationships
- [ ] Explain design patterns used (Observer, Facade, Strategy)

### 2. Refactoring Summary Reports
- [x] musicfile-refactoring-summary.md ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] metadata-editor-refactoring-summary.md ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Update developer-log.md with final session summary

### 3. Technical Metrics
